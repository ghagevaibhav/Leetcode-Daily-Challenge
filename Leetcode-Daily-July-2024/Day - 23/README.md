# Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

## Algorithm

1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The function `frequencySort` takes a vector of integers `nums`.
   - Initialize an integer `n` to store the size of `nums`.
   - Create a `map<int, int>` called `freq` to store the frequency of each element in `nums`.

2. **Counting Frequencies:**
   - Iterate over each element `x` in `nums` using a `for` loop.
   - For each element `x`, increment its count in the `freq` map.

3. **Sorting with Custom Comparator:**
   - Use the `sort` function to sort `nums` in-place with a custom comparator lambda function `[&freq](int a, int b)`.
   - The lambda function performs the following checks:
     - If the frequencies of `a` and `b` are equal, sort `a` and `b` in descending order (`a > b`).
     - If the frequencies are not equal, sort based on the frequency in ascending order (`freq[a] < freq[b]`).

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the sorted vector `nums`.

## Complexity

### Time Complexity

1. **Frequency Counting:**
   - Counting the frequency of each element takes O(n) time, where `n` is the size of the input vector `nums`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting the vector using the `sort` function with a custom comparator takes O(n log n) time.

3. **Overall Time Complexity:**
   - The overall time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, as it dominates the frequency counting step.

### Space Complexity

1. **Auxiliary Space:**
   - The `map` used for storing frequencies has a space complexity of O(n) in the worst case, where each element in `nums` is unique.

2. **Overall Space Complexity:**
   - The overall space complexity is O(n) due to the additional space used by the `map`.

Thus, the algorithm efficiently sorts the elements by their frequency and value with a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(n).
