# Minimum Operations to Return to Root Directory

## Algorithm Explanation

This algorithm solves the problem of finding the minimum number of operations needed to return to the root directory, given a series of file system operations.

1. Initialize a counter `steps` to 0, representing the current depth in the file system.
2. Iterate through each operation in the logs:
   - If the operation is "../" (move up):
     - If `steps` is greater than 0, decrement `steps`.
     - If `steps` is 0, remain at 0 (cannot go above root).
   - If the operation is "./" (remain in current directory):
     - Do nothing (steps remain unchanged).
   - For any other operation (moving into a named directory):
     - Increment `steps` by 1.
3. After processing all operations, return the final value of `steps`.

## Time Complexity

- The algorithm iterates through the logs array once.
- Each operation (comparison and arithmetic) inside the loop takes constant time.
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of operations in the logs.

## Space Complexity

- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space (only the `steps` variable).
- No additional data structures are used that scale with input size.
- Thus, the space complexity is O(1) (constant space).

## Efficiency

This algorithm is efficient as it:
- Processes each log entry only once.
- Uses constant extra space.
- Doesn't require any preprocessing or post-processing of the data.

The solution directly simulates the file system operations, making it intuitive and straightforward to implement and understand.
