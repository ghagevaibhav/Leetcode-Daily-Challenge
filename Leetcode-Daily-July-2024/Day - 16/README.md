# Algorithm Explanation and Complexity Analysis

## Algorithm Explanation

### `lca` Function
The `lca` function finds the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes, `p` and `q`, in a binary tree.

1. **Base Case**: If the current node is `nullptr`, return `nullptr`.
2. **Recursive Case**:
    - Recursively find the LCA in the left subtree (`leftside`).
    - Recursively find the LCA in the right subtree (`rightside`).
    - If both `leftside` and `rightside` are non-null, or the current node is either `p` or `q`, the current node is the LCA.
    - Otherwise, return the non-null side (either `leftside` or `rightside`).

### `dfs` Function
The `dfs` function performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the paths from the LCA to the nodes `p` and `q`.

1. **Base Case**: If the current node is `nullptr`, return.
2. **Check for `p` and `q`**:
    - If the current node's value is `p`, store the current path in `lcatostart`.
    - If the current node's value is `q`, store the current path in `lcatoend`.
3. **Recursive Case**:
    - Append 'L' to the path and recursively call `dfs` on the left child.
    - Backtrack by removing the last character from the path.
    - Append 'R' to the path and recursively call `dfs` on the right child.
    - Backtrack by removing the last character from the path.

### `getDirections` Function
The `getDirections` function combines the functionalities of `lca` and `dfs` to find the directions from `startValue` to `destValue`.

1. **Find LCA**: Use the `lca` function to find the LCA of `startValue` and `destValue`.
2. **Find Paths**: Use the `dfs` function to find the paths from the LCA to `startValue` and `destValue`.
3. **Convert Path**:
    - Convert the path to `startValue` to 'U' (indicating upward movement).
    - Concatenate the path to `startValue` with the path to `destValue`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **LCA Calculation (`lca` function)**:
  - Each node is visited once.
  - Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

- **Path Finding (`dfs` function)**:
  - Each node is visited once during the DFS traversal.
  - Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

- **Overall Time Complexity**: O(N), as both the `lca` and `dfs` functions run in O(N) time.

### Space Complexity
- **Recursive Call Stack**:
  - The maximum depth of the recursion stack is equal to the height of the tree.
  - Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree.

- **Path Storage**:
  - The paths `lcatostart` and `lcatoend` store the directions from the LCA to the nodes `p` and `q`.
  - Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree.

- **Overall Space Complexity**: O(H), dominated by the recursion stack and path storage.
