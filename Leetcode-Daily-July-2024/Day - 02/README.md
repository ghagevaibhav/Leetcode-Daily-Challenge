# Intersection of Two Arrays II - Algorithm and Complexity

## Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty vector `ans` to store the intersection result.
2. Sort both input vectors `nums1` and `nums2`.
3. Use two pointers, `i` for `nums1` and `j` for `nums2`, both starting at 0.
4. While both pointers are within their respective array bounds:
   - If `nums1[i]` < `nums2[j]`, increment `i`.
   - If `nums2[j]` < `nums1[i]`, increment `j`.
   - If `nums1[i]` == `nums2[j]`:
     - Add this element to `ans`.
     - Increment both `i` and `j`.
5. Return the `ans` vector containing the intersection.

## Time Complexity

- Sorting both arrays: O(m log m + n log n), where m and n are the lengths of nums1 and nums2 respectively.
- Two-pointer comparison: O(min(m, n))
- Overall time complexity: O(m log m + n log n)

## Space Complexity

- O(min(m, n)) for the output array in the worst case.
- O(1) additional space excluding the output array.
- If we consider the space used by the sorting algorithm (which typically uses O(log n) space for the call stack in quicksort), the space complexity would be O(log m + log n).

## Notes

- This algorithm maintains the frequency of elements in the intersection.
- It's efficient when the arrays are already sorted or when the cost of sorting is acceptable.
- For unsorted arrays with a large difference in size, a hash table approach might be more efficient.
