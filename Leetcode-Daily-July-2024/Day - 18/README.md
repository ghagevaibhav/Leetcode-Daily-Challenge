# Algorithm Explanation

## Problem Statement
The problem is to count the number of good leaf node pairs in a binary tree. A pair of leaf nodes (x, y) is considered good if the shortest path between them is less than or equal to a given distance.

## Approach
1. **Recursive Function (`recur`)**:
    - The function `recur` is used to recursively calculate the distances of leaf nodes from the current node and to count the good leaf node pairs.
    - **Base Case**:
        - If the node is `null`, return a vector containing a single element `0`.
        - If the node is a leaf (both left and right children are `null`), return a vector containing a single element `1`, which indicates the leaf node's distance from itself.
    - **Recursive Case**:
        - Recursively calculate the distances of leaf nodes for the left and right subtrees.
        - For each pair of distances `(x, y)` from the left and right subtrees respectively, check if the sum of these distances is less than or equal to the given distance. If so, increment the count of good leaf node pairs.
        - Collect the distances of leaf nodes from both subtrees that are less than the given distance and increment them by 1 to account for the current node.

2. **Main Function (`countPairs`)**:
    - Initialize a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of good leaf node pairs.
    - Call the recursive function `recur` with the root node and the given distance.
    - Return the counter `cnt`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- The recursive function `recur` visits each node of the tree exactly once.
- For each node, the function performs a nested loop to count pairs of leaf nodes, which may take up to `O(d^2)` time where `d` is the given distance.
- However, since `d` is typically small and fixed, the overall time complexity is dominated by the tree traversal, resulting in `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is determined by the depth of the recursion stack, which is `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree.
- Additionally, each call to `recur` function maintains a vector of distances, but the size of this vector is bounded by the given distance `d`. Hence, the auxiliary space used by the vectors is `O(d)`.
- Combining both, the overall space complexity is `O(h + d)`.

## Summary
- The algorithm efficiently counts the number of good leaf node pairs using a recursive approach.
- It leverages depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and uses vectors to store and compare distances of leaf nodes.
- The time complexity is `O(n)`, and the space complexity is `O(h + d)`.
