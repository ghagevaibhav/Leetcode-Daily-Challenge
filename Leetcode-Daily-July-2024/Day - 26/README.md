# Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

## Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize a distance matrix `dis` of size `n x n` with a large value (10001) to represent infinite distance.
    - Initialize `res` to 0 to store the result city.
    - Initialize `smallest` to `n` to keep track of the smallest number of reachable cities.

2. **Populate Distance Matrix**:
    - For each edge in the `edges` list, update the distance between the two cities in the `dis` matrix.

3. **Self-Distance**:
    - Set the distance from each city to itself as 0.

4. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:
    - Apply the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to update the `dis` matrix with the shortest paths between all pairs of cities:
        - For each intermediate city `k` from 0 to `n-1`:
            - For each city `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
                - For each city `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
                    - Update the distance `dis[i][j]` to be the minimum of `dis[i][j]` and `dis[i][k] + dis[k][j]`.

5. **Finding the Result City**:
    - For each city `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
        - Initialize `count` to 0 to count the number of reachable cities.
        - For each city `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
            - If the distance `dis[i][j]` is within the `distanceThreshold`, increment `count`.
        - If `count` is less than or equal to `smallest`, update `res` to `i` and `smallest` to `count`.

6. **Return Result**:
    - Return `res`, which is the city with the smallest number of reachable cities within the `distanceThreshold`.

## Complexity

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Initializing the distance matrix takes `O(n^2)` time.
- **Populate Distance Matrix**: Updating the distance for each edge takes `O(E)` time, where `E` is the number of edges.
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: The triple nested loop for the Floyd-Warshall algorithm takes `O(n^3)` time.
- **Finding the Result City**: Counting reachable cities for each city takes `O(n^2)` time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which is `O(n^3)`.

### Space Complexity

- The primary space usage is the distance matrix `dis` which requires `O(n^2)` space.

Therefore, the space complexity is `O(n^2)`.
