# Algorithm Explanation and Complexity Analysis

## Algorithm Explanation

The problem is to arrange books on shelves of a given width such that the total height of the shelves is minimized. Each book has a width and a height, and we need to maintain the order of the books.

The solution uses dynamic programming to find the optimal arrangement. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Let `n` be the number of books.
   - Create a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `n + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum height needed to place the first `i` books.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to 0, since no books mean no height.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - Iterate through each book from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each book `i`, calculate the minimum height by trying to place it on the current shelf or starting a new shelf.
   - Initialize `total_width` to 0 to track the current total width of the books on the current shelf.
   - Initialize `max_height` to 0 to track the maximum height of the books on the current shelf.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - For each book `i`, iterate backward from the current book `i` to the first book. Add each book's width to `total_width`.
   - If `total_width` exceeds the given shelf width (`shelfWidth`), break the loop since no more books can be placed on this shelf.
   - Update `max_height` to the maximum height of the books on the current shelf.
   - Update `dp[i]` to the minimum height by comparing the current `dp[i]` and the height obtained by placing books from `j` to `i` on the current shelf plus `dp[j-1]`.

4. **Return**:
   - Return `dp[n]`, which contains the minimum height needed to place all books.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- The outer loop runs from 1 to `n`, and the inner loop runs backward from `i` to 1. In the worst case, for each book, the inner loop might iterate through all previous books.
- Thus, the time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).

### Space Complexity
- The algorithm uses an array `dp` of size `n + 1`.
- Thus, the space complexity is \(O(n)\).

Overall, the algorithm efficiently computes the minimum height to arrange the books on shelves with a given width, leveraging dynamic programming to consider all possible configurations.
