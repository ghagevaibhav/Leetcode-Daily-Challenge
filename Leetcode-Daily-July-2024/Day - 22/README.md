# Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

## Algorithm

The goal of this algorithm is to sort a list of people by their heights in descending order. Given two input vectors, `names` (containing the names of people) and `heights` (containing their corresponding heights), the algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. **Initialize Vectors**:
   - Create an empty vector `ans` to store the final sorted list of names.
   - Create a vector `v` of pairs to store the height-name pairs.

2. **Populate the Vector**:
   - Iterate through the input vectors `names` and `heights`.
   - For each index `i`, create a pair of `heights[i]` and `names[i]`.
   - Push this pair into the vector `v`.

3. **Sort the Vector**:
   - Use the `sort` function to sort the vector `v` in descending order based on heights. This is achieved by calling `sort(v.rbegin(), v.rend())`.

4. **Extract Sorted Names**:
   - Iterate through the sorted vector `v`.
   - For each pair in `v`, extract the name (second element of the pair) and push it into the `ans` vector.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the `ans` vector, which now contains the names sorted by their heights in descending order.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization and Population**:
   - Creating the vector `v` of pairs and populating it takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the number of elements in the input vectors `names` and `heights`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting the vector `v` of pairs takes `O(n log n)` time because the `sort` function is used, which typically has a time complexity of `O(n log n)` for comparison-based sorting algorithms.

3. **Extracting Sorted Names**:
   - Iterating through the sorted vector `v` and extracting the names takes `O(n)` time.

Overall, the dominant term is the sorting step, so the total time complexity is:
\[ O(n \log n) \]

### Space Complexity

1. **Auxiliary Space**:
   - The algorithm uses additional space for the vector `v` of pairs, which has a size of `n`.
   - The `ans` vector also has a size of `n`.

Therefore, the total space complexity is:
\[ O(n) \]

## Summary

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)

This algorithm efficiently sorts the names based on their heights in descending order with a time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \) and uses linear space, making it both time and space efficient.
