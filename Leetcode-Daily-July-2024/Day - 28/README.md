# Algorithm Explanation

## Problem
Given a graph with `n` nodes and edges represented as a list of pairs, where each edge has a traversal time `time` and there are traffic lights with a cycle `change` (green and red alternating every `change` units of time), find the time it takes to reach the target node `n` from the start node `1` through the second shortest path.

## Algorithm

1. **Graph Representation**:
    - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph. Each node points to its neighbors based on the given edges.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Shortest Path**:
    - Perform a BFS starting from the target node (node `n`) to compute the shortest path distances from the target node to all other nodes. Store these distances in an array `d`.

3. **Finding the Second Shortest Path**:
    - The length of the shortest path from node `0` to node `n-1` is `d[0]`.
    - To find the second shortest path, initiate a BFS from the start node (node `0`).
    - The second shortest path must be either `d[0] + 1` or `d[0] + 2`. Check for the existence of a path with length `d[0] + 1`:
      - Traverse the graph and look for neighbors with the same distance `d[cur]`. If found, decrement the path length `len`.
      - If a neighbor with a distance `d[cur] - 1` is found, continue the BFS.
    - If a path with length `d[0] + 1` is found, set the path length to `d[0] + 1`, otherwise set it to `d[0] + 2`.

4. **Time Calculation**:
    - Calculate the total time to traverse the path considering the traffic light cycles:
      - The traffic light is green for the first `change` units of time and red for the next `change` units, alternating indefinitely.
      - Traverse each edge in the path, and if the current time falls in a red light period, wait until it turns green before proceeding.
      - Add the traversal time for each edge to the total time.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Graph Representation**: `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of edges.
- **BFS for Shortest Path**: `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of nodes and `E` is the number of edges. Each node and edge is processed once.
- **Finding the Second Shortest Path**: `O(V + E)`. Another BFS is used, processing each node and edge once.
- **Time Calculation**: `O(L)`, where `L` is the length of the second shortest path, as each segment is considered once.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(V + E)`.

### Space Complexity
- **Graph Representation**: `O(V + E)` for the adjacency list.
- **BFS for Shortest Path**: `O(V)` for the distance array and queue.
- **Finding the Second Shortest Path**: `O(V)` for the queue and additional variables.
- **Time Calculation**: `O(1)` for constant space usage during traversal.

Overall, the space complexity is `O(V + E)`.
