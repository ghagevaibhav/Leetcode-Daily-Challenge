# Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

## Algorithm Explanation

The provided code calculates the maximum importance of nodes in a graph represented by `n` nodes and `roads`, where each road is represented as an edge between two nodes. The importance of a node is determined by the sum of its degree multiplied by its position in a sorted list of degrees.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize a vector `degrees` of size `n` to store the degree (number of connections) of each node initially set to zero.

2. **Degree Calculation**:
   - Iterate through each edge in the `roads` vector.
   - For each edge `(u, v)`, increment the degree of both `u` and `v` in the `degrees` array.

3. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the `degrees` array in ascending order. This sorting operation takes \( O(n \log n) \) time complexity using a comparison-based sorting algorithm like QuickSort or MergeSort.

4. **Importance Calculation**:
   - Initialize `value` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - Traverse through the sorted `degrees` array. For each degree value `deg`:
     - Add `deg * value` to `ans`.
     - Increment `value` by 1.
   - This calculates the total importance as the sum of degrees multiplied by their respective positions in the sorted array.

5. **Return**:
   - Return the computed `ans` as the maximum importance of the nodes in the graph.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The most time-consuming operation is the sorting of the `degrees` array, which takes \( O(n \log n) \) time.
  - Iterating through the `degrees` array to calculate the importance takes \( O(n) \) time.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step: \( O(n \log n) \).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - Additional space is used for the `degrees` array, which is \( O(n) \).
  - Sorting typically requires \( O(\log n) \) space for recursive calls (if using algorithms like QuickSort or MergeSort).
  - Thus, the total space complexity is \( O(n) \).

## Conclusion

The algorithm efficiently calculates the maximum importance of nodes in the graph using sorting and linear traversal techniques, resulting in a time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \) and a space complexity of \( O(n) \). This approach ensures that we can handle reasonably large graphs within acceptable computational limits.
