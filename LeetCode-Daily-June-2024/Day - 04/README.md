### Algorithm Explanation

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `strLength` to store the length of the input string `s`.
   - `oddCount` to keep track of the number of characters that have an odd frequency.
   - `charFrequency` as a map to store the frequency of each character in the string.

2. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   - Iterate through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - Increment the frequency of `c` in the `charFrequency` map.
   - If the updated frequency of `c` is odd, increment `oddCount`.
   - If the updated frequency of `c` is even, decrement `oddCount`.

3. **Determine Longest Palindrome Length:**
   - If `oddCount` is greater than 1, return `strLength - oddCount + 1`. This adjusts the total length by accounting for the characters with odd frequencies, allowing one to be placed in the center of the palindrome.
   - If `oddCount` is at most 1, return `strLength`. The entire string can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**
  - **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we iterate through the string once to count the frequencies of the characters.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - **O(1)** for the `oddCount` variable.
  - **O(k)** for the `charFrequency` map, where `k` is the number of unique characters in the string. In the worst case, `k` is constant (256 for extended ASCII or 128 for standard ASCII), making the space complexity effectively **O(1)**.
