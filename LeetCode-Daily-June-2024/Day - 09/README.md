# Algorithm Explanation and Complexity Analysis

## Algorithm Explanation

The algorithm aims to find the number of subarrays whose sum is divisible by a given integer `k`. It leverages the concept of prefix sums and their remainders when divided by `k` to efficiently count such subarrays. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
    - `n`: The size of the input array `nums`.
    - `ans`: A variable to store the final count of subarrays whose sum is divisible by `k`.
    - `pre`: A variable to store the cumulative sum modulo `k`.
    - `sub`: A vector of size `k` to store the frequency of each possible remainder (0 to `k-1`) when the cumulative sum is divided by `k`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
    - Set `sub[0]` to 1 because a cumulative sum that is exactly divisible by `k` is considered to occur once initially (an empty subarray).

3. **Iterate Through the Array:**
    - For each element `x` in the array `nums`, update the cumulative sum `pre` modulo `k`.
    - Use the expression `(pre + x % k + k) % k` to ensure that the result is always non-negative, even if `x` is negative.
    - Increment `ans` by the number of times the current remainder `pre` has been seen before (i.e., `sub[pre]`).
    - Increment the frequency of the current remainder `pre` in the `sub` vector.

4. **Return the Result:**
    - The variable `ans` now contains the total count of subarrays whose sum is divisible by `k`. Return `ans`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The algorithm processes each element of the array exactly once, performing a constant amount of work for each element (updating the cumulative sum, accessing and updating the `sub` vector). Thus, the time complexity is:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is determined by the additional data structures used in the algorithm:
- The `sub` vector has a fixed size of `k`, regardless of the input size.
- Other variables (`n`, `ans`, `pre`) use a constant amount of space.

Thus, the space complexity is:
- **O(k)**, where `k` is the given integer for which we are finding subarrays whose sum is divisible by `k`.
