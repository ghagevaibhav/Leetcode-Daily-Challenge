## Algorithm Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - Compute the lengths of strings `s` and `t` and store them in `n` and `m` respectively.
   - Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to 0. `i` will be used to traverse `s` and `j` will be used to traverse `t`.

2. **Traversal**:
   - Use a `while` loop to traverse both strings simultaneously. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n` (length of `s`) and `j` is less than `m` (length of `t`).
   - Inside the loop, compare the current characters of `s` and `t`:
     - If `s[i]` matches `t[j]`, increment `j` to move to the next character in `t`.
     - Always increment `i` to move to the next character in `s`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - After exiting the loop, `j` will indicate the position in `t` up to which characters have been matched.
   - The number of characters that need to be appended to `s` to make `t` a subsequence is given by `m - j`.

4. **Return**:
   - Return the value `m - j` as the result.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + m)`
  - The algorithm traverses each character of `s` and `t` at most once. In the worst case, where there are no matching characters or one of the strings is empty, each string is fully traversed, leading to a linear time complexity with respect to the combined lengths of `s` and `t`.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size. Only a few integer variables are used for pointers and lengths.
