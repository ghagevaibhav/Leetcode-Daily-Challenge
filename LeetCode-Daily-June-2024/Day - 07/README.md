# Algorithm Explanation and Complexity Analysis

## Algorithm Explanation

The algorithm aims to replace words in a sentence with their corresponding roots from a given dictionary, if applicable. The steps are as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a `stringstream` to split the input `sentence` into individual words.
   - Store the extracted words in a vector `strArr`.

2. **Word Replacement**:
   - Iterate through each word in `strArr`.
   - For each word in `strArr`, check against each word in the `dictionary`.
   - If a word in `strArr` starts with a word from the `dictionary`, replace the word in `strArr` with the dictionary word.

3. **Join Words**:
   - Create a new string `res` to build the final sentence.
   - Concatenate each word from `strArr` into `res`, adding spaces as necessary.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the modified sentence `res`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **Splitting the Sentence**:
  - The time complexity for splitting the sentence into words is `O(k)`, where `k` is the length of the sentence.

- **Word Replacement**:
  - Let `m` be the number of words in the sentence and `n` be the number of words in the dictionary.
  - For each word in the sentence (m words), we check each word in the dictionary (n words).
  - Checking if a word starts with a dictionary word can take `O(L)` time in the worst case, where `L` is the maximum length of a word.
  - Hence, the total time complexity for this step is `O(m * n * L)`.

- **Joining Words**:
  - The time complexity for joining the words back into a sentence is `O(k)`, where `k` is the length of the sentence.

Combining all steps, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n * L + k)`.

### Space Complexity

- **Auxiliary Space**:
  - We use a vector `strArr` to store the words from the sentence, which takes `O(m)` space.
  - The dictionary is provided as input, so no additional space is required for it.
  - The `stringstream` and other variables take constant space `O(1)`.

- **Result Space**:
  - The result string `res` requires space proportional to the length of the sentence `O(k)`.

Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(m + k)`.

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n * L + k)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m + k)`
