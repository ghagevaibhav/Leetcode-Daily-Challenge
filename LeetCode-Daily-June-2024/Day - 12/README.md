## Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

### Algorithm

The algorithm used in this solution is the Dutch National Flag algorithm, which efficiently sorts an array containing only the elements 0, 1, and 2. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `start` is set to the beginning of the array (0).
   - `mid` is also set to the beginning of the array (0).
   - `end` is set to the end of the array (n - 1), where n is the size of the array.

2. **Traversal**:
   - Traverse the array using the `mid` pointer.
   - While `mid` is less than or equal to `end`:
     - If `nums[mid]` is 0:
       - Swap `nums[mid]` with `nums[start]`.
       - Increment both `start` and `mid`.
     - Else if `nums[mid]` is 1:
       - Just move the `mid` pointer to the right.
     - Else:
       - Swap `nums[mid]` with `nums[end]`.
       - Decrement `end`.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `mid` surpasses `end`, ensuring all elements are sorted correctly.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. The algorithm scans the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The algorithm sorts the array in place, using only a constant amount of extra space.
