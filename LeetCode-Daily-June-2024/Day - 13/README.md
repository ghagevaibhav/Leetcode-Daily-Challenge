# Algorithm Explanation

1. **Initialization**: 
   - A class `Solution` is defined with a public method `minMovesToSeat`.
   - The method takes two vectors of integers, `seats` and `students`, as inputs.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Both `seats` and `students` vectors are sorted in ascending order. This is done to align the smallest values with each other, which minimizes the movement required.

3. **Calculating Minimum Moves**:
   - Initialize a variable `ans` to zero. This will hold the total number of moves.
   - Iterate over the length of the `seats` vector.
     - For each index `i`, calculate the absolute difference between the `i-th` element of `seats` and `students`.
     - Add this difference to `ans`.

4. **Returning Result**:
   - The method returns `ans`, which represents the total minimum moves required to seat all students.

# Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Sorting the `seats` vector: \( O(n log n) \)
   - Sorting the `students` vector: \( O(n log n) \)
   - Iterating over the vectors to calculate the total moves: \( O(n) \)
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is \( O(n log n) \).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is \( O(1) \) excluding the input and output since we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables like `ans`.
