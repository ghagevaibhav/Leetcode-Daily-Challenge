# Algorithm Explanation and Complexity Analysis

## Algorithm

1. **Compute Prefix Sum Array:**
   - Initialize an array `pre` of the same size as `nums`.
   - Set `pre[0]` to `nums[0]`.
   - Iterate over the elements of `nums` starting from index 1:
     - For each index `i`, set `pre[i]` to `pre[i-1] + nums[i]`.

2. **Modulo Operation on Prefix Sums:**
   - Iterate over the elements of `pre`:
     - For each index `i`, set `pre[i]` to `pre[i] % k`.

3. **Use HashMap to Track First Occurrence of Prefix Sums:**
   - Initialize a map `mp` to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum modulo `k`.
   - Add the entry `(0, -1)` to `mp` to handle subarrays starting from index 0.

4. **Check for Valid Subarray:**
   - Iterate over the elements of `pre`:
     - For each index `i`, check if `pre[i]` is already in `mp`.
     - If it is, calculate the difference between the current index `i` and the stored index `ind1` where `pre[i]` was first seen.
     - If the difference is at least 2, return `true` (indicating a valid subarray is found).
     - If `pre[i]` is not in `mp`, add the entry `(pre[i], i)` to `mp`.

5. **Return Result:**
   - If no valid subarray is found after the loop, return `false`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - Computing the prefix sum array takes `O(n)` time.
- **Modulo Operation:**
  - Applying the modulo operation on each element of the prefix sum array takes `O(n)` time.
- **HashMap Operations:**
  - Each lookup and insertion in the hash map takes `O(1)` on average.
  - Iterating through the `pre` array and performing hash map operations takes `O(n)` time.

Overall, the algorithm runs in `O(n)` time.

### Space Complexity
- **Prefix Sum Array:**
  - The `pre` array requires `O(n)` space.
- **HashMap:**
  - In the worst case, the hash map could store up to `n` entries, requiring `O(n)` space.

Overall, the space complexity is `O(n)`.

### Summary
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

This makes the algorithm efficient for large input sizes.
