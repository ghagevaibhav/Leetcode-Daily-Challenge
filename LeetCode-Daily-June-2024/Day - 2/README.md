### Algorithm Explanation
1. **Function Definition**: The function `reverseString` is defined as a member of the `Solution` class. It takes a reference to a `vector<char>` as its parameter.
2. **Reverse the Vector**: Inside the function, the `reverse` function from the C++ Standard Library is used. This function reverses the elements in the range specified by the two iterators `s.begin()` and `s.end()`, which correspond to the beginning and end of the vector `s`.
3. **In-Place Operation**: The `reverse` function operates in-place, meaning that it modifies the original vector `s` directly without needing additional space for another vector.

### Complexity Explanation
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the `reverse` function is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the vector `s`. This is because each element is moved exactly once to its new position during the reversal.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) (constant space) because the reversal is done in-place, and no extra space proportional to the input size is used. Only a small, constant amount of extra space is needed for the iterators and temporary variables used during the swap operations.
