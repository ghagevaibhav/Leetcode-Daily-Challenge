## Algorithm Explanation

The problem is to determine if two arrays, `target` and `arr`, can be made equal by sorting. The solution involves the following steps:

1. **Sorting the Arrays**:
   - Sort both `arr` and `target` arrays. Sorting rearranges the elements in ascending order.

2. **Comparing Elements**:
   - After sorting, iterate through the elements of both arrays.
   - Compare each element at the corresponding indices of the sorted arrays.
   - If any pair of elements is not equal, return `false`.

3. **Returning the Result**:
   - If all elements are equal after sorting and comparing, return `true`.

## Complexity Explanation

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting**: Sorting each array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. Since we need to sort two arrays, this step is \(2 \times O(n \log n)\), which simplifies to \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Comparison Loop**: Comparing the elements of both sorted arrays takes \(O(n)\) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
\[ O(n \log n) + O(n) = O(n \log n) \]

### Space Complexity:
- The sorting algorithm (typically Timsort) used by the `sort` function is in-place and uses \(O(1)\) additional space.
- The space used by variables and for iteration is minimal.

Thus, the space complexity is:
\[ O(1) \]
