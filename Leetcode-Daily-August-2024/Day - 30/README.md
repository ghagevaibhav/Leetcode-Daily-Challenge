# Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

## Algorithm

### Problem Overview
The problem requires modifying the weights of certain edges in an undirected graph such that the shortest path from a given source node to a destination node equals a specified target distance. The edges that can be modified initially have a weight of `-1`.

### Steps

1. **Graph Representation**: 
   - The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each node stores its connected neighbors along with the respective edge weights.
   - Initially, only edges with non-negative weights are added to the graph.

2. **Initial Shortest Path Calculation**:
   - Dijkstra's algorithm is run on the initial graph to calculate the shortest path from the source to the destination.
   - If the shortest path is less than the target distance, it is impossible to achieve the target by increasing weights, so an empty result is returned.
   - If the shortest path equals the target, no modifications are necessary, but if it's greater, adjustments need to be made.

3. **Edge Weight Modification**:
   - The algorithm iterates through all edges with `-1` weight.
   - If the current shortest path already matches the target, these edges are set to a large value (`INF`), indicating they shouldn't be used.
   - If the shortest path exceeds the target, these edges are initially assigned a weight of `1` to start the modification process.
   - After each modification, Dijkstra's algorithm is re-run to check the new shortest path.
   - If the new shortest path is less than or equal to the target, the edge weight is adjusted upwards to match the target distance exactly.

4. **Result**:
   - The modified edges are returned if the target distance can be achieved; otherwise, an empty list is returned.

## Complexity

### Time Complexity
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: O(E log V) for each run, where `E` is the number of edges and `V` is the number of vertices.
- **Total Complexity**: The worst-case time complexity involves running Dijkstra's algorithm for each edge with a `-1` weight. If there are `k` such edges, the overall complexity is O(k * E log V). However, in practice, this is often less due to early exits when the target distance is met.

### Space Complexity
- **Graph Storage**: O(V + E), where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.
- **Dijkstra's Data Structures**: O(V) for the min-heap and distance tracking.
- **Total Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for storing the graph and additional space for Dijkstra's algorithm.
