# Postorder Traversal of N-ary Tree

## Algorithm Explanation

### Postorder Traversal Overview
Postorder traversal is a type of depth-first search (DFS) where the nodes of a tree are processed in the following order:
1. Traverse all the children of the current node.
2. Process the current node (i.e., visit the node after its children).

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Base Case:** 
   - If the current node (`root`) is `NULL`, return immediately. This handles the scenario where the node doesn't exist (e.g., when the tree is empty).

2. **Recursive Traversal:**
   - For each child node of the current node, recursively perform the postorder traversal.
   - This ensures that all the descendants of a node are processed before the node itself.

3. **Processing the Node:**
   - After processing all the children of the current node, add the node's value to the result list.

4. **Return Result:**
   - The postorder traversal function returns the list of node values in postorder.

### Example
Given an N-ary tree, the algorithm will start at the root, traverse down to the leaf nodes, and add each node's value to the result list after all its children have been added.

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity
- **O(N):** 
  - The algorithm visits each node exactly once, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - For each node, it processes all its children, leading to a linear time complexity relative to the number of nodes.

### Space Complexity
- **O(N):**
  - The space complexity is primarily due to the space required to store the postorder traversal result, which is proportional to the number of nodes, `N`.
  - Additionally, the recursion stack can go as deep as the height of the tree. In the worst case (for highly unbalanced trees), the height can be `N`, leading to an additional space complexity of `O(N)`.

### Summary
- **Overall Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
- **Overall Space Complexity:** `O(N)`
