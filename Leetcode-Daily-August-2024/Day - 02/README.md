## Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

### Algorithm

1. **Calculate the Total Number of 1's**:
    - Use the `accumulate` function to sum up all elements in the `nums` array, which gives the total number of 1's in the array.
    ```cpp
    int total = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
    ```

2. **Get the Size of the Array**:
    - Store the size of the array in a variable `n`.
    ```cpp
    int n = nums.size();
    ```

3. **Initial Count of 1's in the First Window**:
    - Calculate the number of 1's in the first `total` elements of the array.
    ```cpp
    int cnt = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + total, 0);
    ```

4. **Initial Maximum Count**:
    - Initialize `maxi` with the initial count of 1's in the first window.
    ```cpp
    int maxi = cnt;
    ```

5. **Sliding Window Approach**:
    - Iterate through the array with a sliding window of size `total`. The loop runs from `total` to `n + total`.
    ```cpp
    for(int i = total; i < n + total; i++) {
        cnt += nums[i % n] - nums[(i - total + n) % n];
        maxi = max(maxi, cnt);
    }
    ```
    - In each iteration:
        - Update `cnt` by adding the next element in the window and subtracting the element that slides out of the window.
        - Update `maxi` to be the maximum count of 1's found in any window of size `total`.

6. **Calculate Minimum Swaps**:
    - The minimum number of swaps required is the difference between the total number of 1's and the maximum count of 1's in any window of size `total`.
    ```cpp
    return total - maxi;
    ```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
    - Calculating the total number of 1's and the initial count of 1's in the first window: \(O(n)\).
    - Sliding window loop: \(O(n)\) iterations, with each iteration taking \(O(1)\) time.
    - Overall time complexity: \(O(n)\).

- **Space Complexity**:
    - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables `total`, `n`, `cnt`, and `maxi`.
    - Overall space complexity: \(O(1)\).

The algorithm efficiently calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to group all 1's together using a sliding window approach with linear time complexity and constant space complexity.
