# Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

## Algorithm

The solution aims to convert a given integer into its English words representation. The process can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the input number is zero, return "Zero".

2. **Initialization**:
   - Define arrays for large number units ("Thousand", "Million", "Billion") and smaller units (single digits, teens, tens).
   
3. **Convert the First Three Digits**:
   - Extract the last three digits of the number and convert them to words using the `numberToWordsHelper` function.
   - Remove the last three digits from the number.

4. **Iterate Through Larger Units**:
   - Loop through the next sets of three digits (thousands, millions, billions).
   - For each set, if the number is greater than zero and the current three digits are not zero, convert them to words and append the corresponding large unit.
   - Continue this process until the entire number is processed.

5. **Format the Result**:
   - Remove any trailing spaces from the final result string.

### Helper Function: `numberToWordsHelper`

This function converts numbers less than 1000 to their English words representation:

1. **Process Hundreds Place**:
   - If the number is greater than 99, convert the hundreds place to words and append "Hundred".
   
2. **Process Tens and Units Place**:
   - If the number is between 10 and 19, use the `teenString` array.
   - If the number is 20 or greater, use the `tenString` array for the tens place and the `digitString` array for the units place.
   - Append the corresponding words for each place.

## Complexity

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the number of digits in the input number.

- The main loop runs at most four times (for units, thousands, millions, and billions), making it a constant-time operation.
- Each iteration involves processing up to three digits, which is a constant-time operation.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(1), or constant time.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the solution is also O(1), as the space used for storing the result string and the arrays for digits, teens, and tens does not depend on the input size.

- The arrays `bigString`, `digitString`, `teenString`, and `tenString` occupy constant space.
- The result string accumulates the final output, but its length is proportional to the number of digits, which is bounded by a constant factor.

Thus, the overall space complexity is O(1), or constant space.
