# Algorithm Explanation: Counting Sub-Islands

## Problem Statement
Given two binary matrices `A` and `B` of the same dimensions, the task is to count the number of sub-islands in matrix `A`. A sub-island in `A` is defined as an island that is entirely contained within an island in `B`. An island is a group of connected `1`s (representing land) surrounded by `0`s (representing water) in all four directions (up, down, left, right).

## Algorithm

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Initialize Variables**:
    - Get the number of rows `m` and columns `n` of the matrix `A`.
    - Initialize a variable `res` to `0` to keep track of the number of sub-islands.

2. **Iterate Over Each Cell**:
    - Traverse each cell in the matrix `A`.
    - If a cell contains `1` (indicating the start of a new island), perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine if it is a sub-island.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Sub-Islands**:
    - For each `1` found in `A`, perform DFS recursively in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
    - Mark the current cell as visited by setting `A[i][j]` to `0`.
    - During DFS, continue exploring the island and ensure that all parts of the island in `A` correspond to land in `B`.
    - If any part of the island in `A` corresponds to water in `B`, the current island in `A` is not a sub-island.
    - Return `1` if the entire island in `A` is contained within an island in `B`, otherwise return `0`.

4. **Count Sub-Islands**:
    - Increment the count `res` by the result of the DFS.
    - Continue this process for all cells in `A`.

5. **Return the Result**:
    - After traversing the entire matrix `A`, return the total count of sub-islands stored in `res`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **O(m * n)**: The algorithm traverses each cell of matrix `A` once, performing a DFS for each unvisited island. In the worst case, the DFS explores all cells of an island, but since each cell is visited exactly once, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n)`.

### Space Complexity
- **O(m * n)**: The space complexity is determined by the recursion stack used in the DFS. In the worst case, the stack can grow up to `O(m * n)` in case the entire grid is one large island.
