# Algorithm Explanation: Spiral Matrix III

## Problem Statement
Given the dimensions of a matrix (`rows`, `cols`) and a starting position (`rStart`, `cStart`), the task is to generate the matrix's spiral order starting from the given position.

## Approach

1. **Initialize Directions**: 
    - We define the four possible movement directions as East (`{0, 1}`), South (`{1, 0}`), West (`{0, -1}`), and North (`{-1, 0}`).
    - These directions are stored in a vector `directions`.

2. **Starting Point**:
    - Initialize the result vector with the starting position (`rStart`, `cStart`).

3. **Simulate Spiral Movement**:
    - Use a variable `steps` to track how many steps to take in the current direction. Initially, `steps = 0`.
    - Use a variable `d` to represent the current direction index. Initially, `d = 0` (East).

4. **Movement Logic**:
    - We continue moving until the result vector contains all positions in the matrix (i.e., `rows * cols`).
    - Increase `steps` after every two direction changes (after moving East and West).
    - For each direction, move `steps` times, updating the current position (`rStart`, `cStart`).
    - If the new position is within the matrix bounds, add it to the result vector.
    - Change the direction by updating `d = (d + 1) % 4`.

5. **Return the Result**:
    - Once all positions are covered, return the result vector containing the spiral order of matrix positions.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **O(rows * cols)**: 
    - The algorithm iterates through every position in the matrix exactly once. Therefore, the total number of operations is proportional to the number of elements in the matrix.

### Space Complexity
- **O(rows * cols)**:
    - The space required to store the result is proportional to the number of elements in the matrix.
    - The `directions` array and a few additional variables consume constant space, i.e., **O(1)**.
    - Therefore, the total space complexity is **O(rows * cols)**.
