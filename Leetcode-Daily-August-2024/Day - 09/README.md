# Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

## Algorithm

### Function: `isValid`

1. **Initialize a count array**:
    - Create a `count` array of size 10 initialized to 0. This array tracks the occurrences of digits from 1 to 9 within the 3x3 grid.

2. **Check the validity of the numbers in the 3x3 grid**:
    - Iterate over each element in the 3x3 grid starting from the top-left corner `(i, j)`.
    - For each element:
        - If the number is less than 1 or greater than 9, or if it has already been encountered in the grid, return `false`.
        - Otherwise, increment the count for that number.

3. **Calculate the sum of the first row**:
    - Compute the sum of the first row in the 3x3 grid.

4. **Check the sum of each row**:
    - Iterate over all rows in the 3x3 grid.
    - For each row, check if the sum of the elements equals the sum of the first row. If not, return `false`.

5. **Check the sum of each column**:
    - Iterate over all columns in the 3x3 grid.
    - For each column, check if the sum of the elements equals the sum of the first row. If not, return `false`.

6. **Check the diagonals**:
    - Compute the sum of the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).
    - If either diagonal's sum does not match the sum of the first row, return `false`.

7. **Return true**:
    - If all checks are passed, return `true`, indicating that the grid forms a magic square.

### Function: `numMagicSquaresInside`

1. **Initialize count**:
    - Initialize a counter `cnt` to 0, which tracks the number of magic squares found.

2. **Check grid dimensions**:
    - If the grid has fewer than 3 rows or 3 columns, return 0 since a 3x3 magic square cannot exist.

3. **Iterate over possible 3x3 subgrids**:
    - Iterate through all possible top-left corners `(i, j)` of 3x3 subgrids in the grid.

4. **Check each subgrid**:
    - For each subgrid, call the `isValid` function. If it returns `true`, increment the counter `cnt`.

5. **Return the result**:
    - Return the value of `cnt`, representing the total number of magic squares found.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **`isValid` Function**:
    - The `isValid` function operates on a fixed 3x3 grid, meaning it always performs a constant number of operations.
    - **Time Complexity**: O(1)

- **`numMagicSquaresInside` Function**:
    - The outer function iterates over all possible top-left corners of 3x3 subgrids within the main grid.
    - If the grid has `m` rows and `n` columns, there are `(m-3+1) * (n-3+1)` possible 3x3 subgrids.
    - For each subgrid, the `isValid` function is called, which takes O(1) time.
    - **Time Complexity**: O((m-2) * (n-2)) â‰ˆ O(m * n)

### Space Complexity

- **`isValid` Function**:
    - The function uses a fixed-size array `count` of size 10, regardless of the input grid size.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(1)

- **`numMagicSquaresInside` Function**:
    - The space complexity is primarily determined by the `isValid` function, which uses O(1) space.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(1)
