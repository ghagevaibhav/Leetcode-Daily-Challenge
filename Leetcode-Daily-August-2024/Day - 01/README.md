# Algorithm Explanation and Complexity Analysis

## Algorithm Explanation

The problem is to count the number of seniors (age > 60) in a given list of details. Each detail is a string, and the age is represented by a specific substring within each string. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define a counter `ans` and initialize it to 0. This counter will keep track of the number of seniors.

2. **Iterate Through Details**:
   - Use a range-based for loop to iterate through each string `x` in the `details` vector.

3. **Extract Age**:
   - For each string `x`, extract the substring that represents the age. The age is found at positions 11 and 12 in the string, so use `x.substr(11, 2)` to get this substring.

4. **Convert and Check Age**:
   - Convert the extracted substring to an integer using `stoi`.
   - Check if the age is greater than 60. If true, increment the `ans` counter by 1.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating through all the details, return the total count of seniors stored in `ans`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- The outer loop iterates through each string in the `details` vector, which has a size of `n`.
- For each string, extracting the substring and converting it to an integer are both \(O(1)\) operations.
- Therefore, the total time complexity is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of strings in the `details` vector.

### Space Complexity
- The algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra space for the counter `ans` and temporary variables for substring extraction and integer conversion.
- Therefore, the space complexity is \(O(1)\), indicating constant space usage.

Overall, the algorithm efficiently counts the number of seniors by iterating through the list of details and performing constant-time operations for each detail.
