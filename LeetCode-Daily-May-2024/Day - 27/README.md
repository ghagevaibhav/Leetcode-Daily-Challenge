## Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

### Algorithm:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Determine the size of the input vector `nums` and store it in `n`.
   - Find the maximum element in `nums` and store it in `maxi`.
   - Initialize a variable `x` to 0.

2. **While Loop**:
   - Loop while `x` is less than or equal to `maxi`.
   - Initialize a counter `cnt` to 0 to keep track of the number of elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to `x`.

3. **Inner For Loop**:
   - Iterate through each element of `nums`.
   - If an element is greater than or equal to `x`, increment the counter `cnt`.

4. **Check for Special Value**:
   - After counting, check if `cnt` is equal to `x`.
   - If they are equal, return `x` as the special value.

5. **Increment x**:
   - If the count is not equal to `x`, increment `x` and continue the loop.

6. **Return -1**:
   - If no such `x` is found after the loop, return `-1` indicating no special value exists in the array.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**:
  - The algorithm involves a nested loop: the outer loop runs from 0 to `maxi` and the inner loop runs through the entire array `nums`.
  - In the worst case, if `maxi` is the maximum element in `nums`, the outer loop runs `maxi + 1` times and the inner loop runs `n` times for each iteration of the outer loop.
  - Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(n \cdot \maxi)\), where `n` is the size of the array and `maxi` is the maximum value in the array.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as no additional space is used other than a few variables for counting and iteration.
