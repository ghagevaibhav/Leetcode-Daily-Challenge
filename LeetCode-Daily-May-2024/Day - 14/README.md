## Algorithm Explanation and Complexity Analysis

### Steps of the Algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans` is initialized to `INT_MIN` to store the maximum gold collected.
   - `row` and `col` vectors represent the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) to move in the grid.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Function**:
   - The `dfs` function explores the grid recursively to collect gold.
   - It checks if the current cell `(x, y)` is out of bounds or if it contains no gold (base case). If true, it returns 0.
   - The current cell's gold is stored in `cur` and the cell is marked as visited by setting it to 0.
   - The `local` variable stores the maximum gold collected starting from this cell.
   - The function then explores all four possible directions by updating `x` and `y` using `row` and `col` vectors, and recursively calls `dfs` for each direction.
   - After exploring all directions, the cell's original value is restored (backtracking).
   - The function returns the maximum gold collected starting from this cell.

3. **Main Function**:
   - `getMaximumGold` initializes the grid dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - It iterates through each cell in the grid.
   - For each cell, it starts a DFS and updates `ans` with the maximum gold collected.
   - Finally, it returns the global maximum amount of gold collected.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The worst-case time complexity is `(O(n * m * 4^k))`, where \(n\) is the number of rows, \(m\) is the number of columns, and \(k\) is the maximum number of cells with gold. This is because each DFS call can branch into 4 directions, and it can potentially explore each cell with gold.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is `O(k)`, where \(k\) is the maximum depth of the recursion stack. In the worst case, this could be all cells containing gold. Additionally, the space used by the `row` and `col` vectors is constant \(O(1)\).
