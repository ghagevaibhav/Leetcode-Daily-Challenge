## Algorithm Steps

1. **Extract Values**:
   - Initialize an empty vector `v`.
   - Traverse the linked list `head` and store the values of each node in vector `v`.

2. **Find Nodes to Remove**:
   - Initialize pointers `h` and `h2` to `head`.
   - Initialize an empty stack `s` and a vector `r`.
   - Iterate through the values in vector `v` from right to left:
     - While the stack is not empty and the value at the top of the stack is less than or equal to the current value, pop elements from the stack.
     - If the stack is empty, push `-1` into vector `r` to indicate no larger element exists.
     - Otherwise, push the index at the top of the stack into vector `r`.
     - Push the current index into the stack.
   - Reverse the vector `r`.

3. **Prepare Indices for Removal**:
   - Initialize a set `st` to store indices of nodes to be removed.
   - Iterate through the elements of vector `r`:
     - If the element is not `-1`, insert its index into the set `st`.

4. **Remove Nodes from Linked List**:
   - Initialize index `i` to 0 and pointer `prev` to `NULL`.
   - Iterate through the linked list using pointer `h`:
     - If the index `i` is present in the set `st`:
       - If `h` is equal to `h2`, move `h` and `h2` to the next nodes.
       - Otherwise, remove the current node by adjusting pointers.
     - If the index `i` is not present in the set `st`, move `prev` to `h`.
     - Increment index `i`.
   - Return the head of the modified list `h2`.

## Time Complexity

- Extracting values: O(n)
- Finding nodes to remove: O(n)
- Removing nodes from linked list: O(n)
- Overall time complexity: O(n)

## Space Complexity

- Additional space for vector `v`, stack `s`, vector `r`, and set `st`: O(n)
