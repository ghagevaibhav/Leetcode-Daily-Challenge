## Algorithm Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`: Get the size of the input strings `s` and `t`.
   - `ans`: Variable to store the maximum length of the substring found. Initialize to -1.
   - `left`: Left pointer for the sliding window. Initialize to 0.
   - `window`: Sum of the costs of transforming the current window of `s` into `t`. Initialize to 0.

2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - **Outer Loop (`right` pointer)**:
     - Traverse through the strings `s` and `t` using the `right` pointer from 0 to `n-1`.
     - Add the cost of transforming the character at the `right` position in `s` to the corresponding character in `t` to the `window` sum.
   
   - **Inner Loop**:
     - If the `window` sum exceeds `maxCost`, move the `left` pointer to the right to reduce the window sum until it is within `maxCost`. This is done by subtracting the cost of the character at the `left` pointer and incrementing the `left` pointer.
   
   - **Updating Answer**:
     - Calculate the current window size as `right - left + 1`.
     - Update `ans` if the current window size is larger than the previous maximum.

3. **Return**:
   - Return the maximum length of the substring where the total transformation cost does not exceed `maxCost`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The algorithm uses a sliding window approach, where each character in the string is processed at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and at most once by the `left` pointer). Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s` (or `t`).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
