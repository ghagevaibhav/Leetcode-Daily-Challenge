## Algorithm Explanation

The algorithm evaluates a binary tree where each node can represent a boolean value (`0` or `1`) or a logical operation (`OR` or `AND`). The tree structure is used to form a boolean expression that needs to be evaluated. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the process.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **TreeNode Structure**:
    - Each node in the binary tree is represented by a `TreeNode` structure.
    - The `TreeNode` contains:
      - `val`: an integer value representing the node's value or operation.
      - `left`: a pointer to the left child node.
      - `right`: a pointer to the right child node.

2. **Solution Class**:
    - The `Solution` class contains methods to evaluate the boolean expression represented by the binary tree.

3. **helper Function**:
    - This function is a recursive function that evaluates the subtree rooted at the given node.
    - **Base Case**: 
        - If the node value (`val`) is `0` or `1`, it represents a boolean value.
        - The function returns `true` if `val` is `1` and `false` if `val` is `0`.
    - **Logical OR Operation**:
        - If `val` is `2`, it represents a logical OR operation.
        - The function recursively evaluates both the left and right subtrees.
        - It returns `true` if either subtree evaluates to `true`.
    - **Logical AND Operation**:
        - If `val` is `3`, it represents a logical AND operation.
        - The function recursively evaluates both the left and right subtrees.
        - It returns `true` only if both subtrees evaluate to `true`.
    - **Fallback Case**:
        - If `val` is not `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`, it is considered invalid.
        - The function returns `false` as a safe fallback.

4. **evaluateTree Function**:
    - This function initiates the evaluation of the boolean expression.
    - It calls the `helper` function with the root node of the binary tree.
    - The result of `helper` is returned as the final result.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: 
    - The algorithm performs a depth-first traversal of the binary tree.
    - Each node is visited once, making the time complexity O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

- **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion stack.
    - In the worst case, the tree is skewed (all nodes have only one child), resulting in a recursion depth of O(N).
    - For a balanced tree, the recursion depth is O(log N).
    - Therefore, the space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree.
