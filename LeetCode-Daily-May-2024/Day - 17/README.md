### Algorithmic Explanation of `removeLeafNodes`

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Base Case (Empty Tree Check):**
   - Check if the current node (`root`) is `nullptr`.
   - If `root` is `nullptr`, return `nullptr`.

2. **Recursive Case (Process Left and Right Subtrees):**
   - Recursively call `removeLeafNodes` on the left child of the current node:
   - Recursively call `removeLeafNodes` on the right child of the current node:

3. **Leaf Node Check:**
   - After processing both subtrees, check if the current node (`root`) is a leaf node. A leaf node is defined as a node with no left or right children:

4. **Target Value Check:**
   - If the current node is a leaf node, check if its value is equal to the target value:

5. **Remove Leaf Node:**
   - If the current node is a leaf node with the value equal to the target, return `nullptr` to remove this node:

6. **Return Current Node:**
   - If the current node is not a leaf node with the target value, return the current node:

#### Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is visited once during the traversal.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree. This accounts for the recursion stack space used during the depth-first traversal. In the worst case, for a skewed tree, the space complexity can be \(O(N)\), and for a balanced tree, it can be \(O(\log N)\).
