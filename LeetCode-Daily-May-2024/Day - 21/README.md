## Algorithm Explanation

The algorithm generates all possible subsets (the power set) of a given set of integers. It utilizes bitwise operations to efficiently create each subset.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a vector `ans` to store all the subsets.
   - Calculate the number of elements `n` in the input vector `nums`.
   - Compute the total number of subsets, which is `2^n`. This is achieved using a left bit shift operation (`1 << n`).

2. **Iterate Over Each Possible Subset**:
   - Use a loop to iterate from `0` to `2^n - 1` (inclusive). Each value of `num` in this range represents a different subset.

3. **Construct Each Subset**:
   - For each `num`, create an empty vector `list` to store the current subset.
   - Use an inner loop to iterate through each bit position from `0` to `n - 1`.
   - For each bit position `i`, check if the `i-th` bit in `num` is set (i.e., `num & (1 << i)` is true).
   - If the bit is set, include `nums[i]` in the current subset `list`.

4. **Store the Subset**:
   - After constructing the subset for a given `num`, add `list` to `ans`.

5. **Return All Subsets**:
   - Once all subsets are generated, return `ans`.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * 2^n)`
  - There are `2^n` possible subsets.
  - For each subset, it takes `O(n)` time to construct it by checking each bit position.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * 2^n)`
  - The space complexity is determined by the space required to store all subsets. There are `2^n` subsets, and in the worst case, each subset could have up to `n` elements.
