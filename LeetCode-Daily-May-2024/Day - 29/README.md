## Algorithm Explanation

The problem is to find the number of steps required to reduce a binary string representation of a number to "1" using the following steps:
1. If the number is even, divide it by 2.
2. If the number is odd, add 1 to it.

### Steps:
1. Initialize `n` to the length of the binary string `s`.
2. Initialize `carry` to 0, which will keep track of the carry during binary addition.
3. Initialize `ans` to `n - 1`, as a minimum of `n - 1` steps are needed to process the entire string.
4. Iterate through the binary string from the second last character to the first:
   - For each bit, check if the current bit plus carry equals 1.
   - If it does, increment `ans` because an additional step is required to make the number even.
   - Set `carry` to 1 to account for the carry in the next iteration.
5. Return the total number of steps (`ans`) plus any remaining carry.

### Example:
For the binary string `s = "1101"`:
1. Start from the rightmost bit (ignoring the last bit initially).
2. At each step, check if adding the carry to the current bit makes it odd.
3. Increment the step count if necessary and adjust the carry accordingly.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the binary string `s`. This is because the algorithm iterates through the string once.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)**. The algorithm uses a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
