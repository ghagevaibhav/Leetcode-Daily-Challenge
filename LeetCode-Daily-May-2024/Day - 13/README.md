## Matrix Scoring Algorithm

### Introduction
This algorithm computes the score of a given matrix based on certain criteria.

### Prerequisites
- The matrix must be represented as a 2D vector.
- The matrix must have at least one row and one column.

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Initialize Variables**
   - `n`: Number of rows in the matrix.
   - `m`: Number of columns in the matrix.
   - `ans`: Initialize the total score to `n` times the value of the leftmost bit in the first column.

2. **Iterate through Columns**
   - Start iterating from the second column (index 1).
   - For each column `j`:
     - Initialize `colcnt` to zero, representing the count of ones in the current column.
     - Iterate through each row `i`:
       - If the first element of the row is zero:
         - Toggle the value of the element in the current column (`grid[i][j]`) and count it as one if it becomes one, or zero if it was already one.
       - Otherwise, count the value of the element in the current column as it is.
     - Check if flipping the current column would increase the score:
       - If the count of ones in the column (`colcnt`) is less than the count of zeros:
         - Update the total score by adding `(n - colcnt)` times the value of the leftmost bit in the current column.
       - Otherwise, update the total score by adding `colcnt` times the value of the leftmost bit in the current column.

3. **Return the Total Score**
   - Once all columns are processed, return the final value of `ans`, which represents the total score of the matrix.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n * m)**: Iterating through each element in the matrix requires visiting each cell once, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns.

### Space Complexity
- **O(1)**: The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space for variables like `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `colcnt`, regardless of the size of the input matrix.

### Conclusion
This algorithm efficiently computes the score of a matrix by iterating through its columns only once and applying the scoring criteria accordingly.
