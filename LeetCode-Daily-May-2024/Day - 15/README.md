# Algorithmic Explanation and Complexity Analysis

## Algorithmic Steps

### Step 1: Initialization
1. Define direction vectors for moving in four possible directions: left, right, up, and down.

### Step 2: BFS to Calculate Minimum Distance
2. Implement a BFS function to calculate the minimum distance (score) from any '1' in the grid.
3. Initialize a queue and set the score for all positions where the grid value is 1 to 0, then push these positions into the queue.
4. Perform BFS to propagate the scores from the initial positions.
5. For each position, explore the four possible directions. If the new position is within bounds and the new score is less than the current score, update the score and push the new position into the queue.

### Step 3: Calculate Maximum Safeness Factor
6. Define the main function to find the maximum safeness factor.
7. If the start (top-left) or end (bottom-right) cell is '1', return 0 as it's not possible to start or end there.
8. Initialize the score matrix with a large value (e.g., `INT_MAX`) to represent unvisited cells.
9. Run BFS to fill in the score matrix.
10. Initialize a visited matrix to keep track of visited cells.
11. Use a max-heap priority queue to keep track of the path with the highest safeness factor, starting from the top-left cell.
12. Implement a Dijkstra-like algorithm to find the path with the maximum safeness factor.
13. For each position, explore the four possible directions. If the new position is within bounds and not visited, update the safeness factor and push the new position into the priority queue.
14. If the bottom-right cell is reached, return the safeness factor.
15. If no path is found, return -1.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- The BFS traversal runs in `O(n^2)` time because each cell is processed once and enqueued at most once.
- The Dijkstra-like algorithm with a priority queue also runs in `O(n^2 log n)` time because there are `O(n^2)` cells, and each cell is pushed and popped from the priority queue, with each operation taking `O(log n^2) = O(2 log n)` time, simplifying to `O(log n)`.

Overall Time Complexity: `O(n^2 log n)`

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is `O(n^2)` due to the additional space required for the score matrix, visited matrix, and the queue used in BFS and the priority queue used in the main function.

Overall Space Complexity: `O(n^2)`
