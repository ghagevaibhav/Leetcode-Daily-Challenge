## Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Get the size of the `score` vector `n`.
   - Create a vector `rankings` of strings to store the ranks.
   - Define a vector `rankName` containing the names for the top three ranks.
   - Find the maximum score in the `score` vector.
   - Create a vector `scoreToIndex` to map each score to its index in the `score` vector.

2. **Map Scores to Index**:
   - Iterate through the `score` vector and map each score to its index in `scoreToIndex`.

3. **Calculate Ranks**:
   - Create an unordered map `rank` to store ranks corresponding to each score.
   - Initialize a rank counter `rankct` to 1.
   - Iterate from the maximum score down to 0.
     - If the score doesn't exist (`scoreToIndex[i] == -1`), continue to the next iteration.
     - Assign the rank to the score and increment the rank counter.

4. **Assign Rankings**:
   - Iterate through the `score` vector.
     - Get the actual rank from the `rank` map.
     - If the actual rank is among the top three, assign the corresponding name from `rankName`, otherwise convert the rank to a string.
     - Store the ranking in the `rankings` vector.

5. **Return Rankings**:
   - Return the `rankings` vector containing the ranks for each score.

## Time Complexity
- Finding the maximum score takes O(n) time.
- Mapping scores to their indices takes O(n) time.
- Calculating ranks takes O(maxScore) time, where `maxScore` is the maximum score.
- Assigning rankings takes O(n) time.
- Overall time complexity is O(n + maxScore).

## Space Complexity
- The algorithm uses additional space for the `rankings`, `rankName`, `scoreToIndex`, and `rank` vectors/maps.
- Space complexity is O(n + maxScore).
