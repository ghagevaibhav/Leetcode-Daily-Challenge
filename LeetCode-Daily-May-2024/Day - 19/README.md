## Algorithm Explanation and Complexities

### Algorithm Explanation

The function `maximumValueSum` aims to maximize the sum of the elements in an array `nums` after performing a bitwise XOR operation with a given integer `k` on each element. The algorithm also needs to ensure the optimal sum by considering the effects of both positive and negative changes induced by the XOR operation.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `totalSum`: Initialize to keep track of the total sum of the original array elements.
   - `count`: Initialize to count the number of elements with a positive net change after the XOR operation.
   - `positiveMin`: Initialize to store the minimum positive net change encountered.
   - `negativeMax`: Initialize to store the maximum negative net change encountered.

2. **Iteration through `nums`**:
   - For each element `nodeValue` in `nums`:
     - Compute `nodeValAfterOperation` as the result of `nodeValue` XOR `k`.
     - Calculate the `netChange` as `nodeValAfterOperation - nodeValue`.
     - Add the original `nodeValue` to `totalSum`.
     - If `netChange` is positive:
       - Update `positiveMin` if `netChange` is the smallest positive net change encountered.
       - Add `netChange` to `totalSum`.
       - Increment `count`.
     - If `netChange` is negative:
       - Update `negativeMax` if `netChange` is the largest negative net change encountered.

3. **Final Adjustment**:
   - If `count` (number of positive changes) is even, return `totalSum` as the result.
   - If `count` is odd, return the maximum of:
     - `totalSum` minus the smallest positive net change (`positiveMin`).
     - `totalSum` plus the largest negative net change (`negativeMax`).

This adjustment ensures that the sum is maximized by making sure that the total number of positive changes remains even if necessary, thereby leveraging the most beneficial changes induced by the XOR operation.

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we iterate through the array once to compute the total sum, net changes, and identify the minimum positive and maximum negative net changes.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`. The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `totalSum`, `count`, `positiveMin`, and `negativeMax`, regardless of the input size.
