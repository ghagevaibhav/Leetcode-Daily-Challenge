## Explanation:

### Initialization:
- `n` is assigned the size of the input vector `nums`.
- `ans` is initialized to 0 to store the cumulative sum of XOR values of all subsets.

### Generating Subsets:
- The outer loop (`for(int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++)`) iterates over all possible subsets of the input vector `nums`. This is done using a bitmask, which ranges from `0` to `(2^n - 1)`. Each bit in the bitmask represents whether a corresponding element in the vector is included in the subset.

### Calculating XOR for Each Subset:
- For each subset represented by `mask`, `xorsub` is initialized to 0.
- The inner loop (`for(int i = 0; i < n; i++))` checks each element of `nums` to see if it is included in the current subset. This is done using the condition `(mask & (1 << i))`, which checks if the `i`-th bit of `mask` is set.
- If the `i`-th bit is set, the corresponding element in `nums` is included in the subset, and its value is XORed with `xorsub`.

### Accumulating the Result:
- After computing the XOR for the current subset, `xorsub` is added to `ans`.

### Returning the Result:
- After all subsets have been processed, the function returns `ans`, which contains the sum of XOR values of all subsets.

## Complexities:

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \cdot 2^n)\), where `n` is the number of elements in the input vector `nums`.
- The outer loop runs \(2^n\) times to iterate over all subsets.
- The inner loop runs `n` times for each subset to compute the XOR of elements in the subset.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is \(O(1)\) (constant space), not considering the input vector `nums` itself.
- Only a few integer variables (`n`, `ans`, `mask`, `xorsub`, and `i`) are used, which occupy constant space.
