## Algorithm Explanation

### Problem Statement
Given an array `A` of integers, we want to count the number of triplets `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k` and the XOR of the subarray from `i` to `j-1` is equal to the XOR of the subarray from `j` to `k`.

### Algorithm

1. **Insert a Zero**: 
    - Insert a `0` at the beginning of the vector `A` to handle prefix XOR calculations more conveniently.
    - This transformation helps in calculating the XOR from the start of the array to any index.

2. **Calculate Prefix XOR**:
    - Compute the prefix XOR for each element in the modified vector.
    - After this step, `A[i]` represents the XOR of all elements from the beginning up to index `i-1` in the original array.

3. **Count Triplets**:
    - Iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
    - For each pair, if the prefix XOR values are the same (`A[i] == A[j]`), it implies that the XOR of the subarray from `i` to `j-1` is `0`.
    - If the above condition holds true, then we can form triplets `(i, k, j)` with `i < k < j`. There are `j - i - 1` possible values for `k`.

4. **Return Result**:
    - The total count of such triplets is accumulated and returned as the result.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
    - Calculating the prefix XOR values takes `O(n)` time.
    - Iterating over all pairs `(i, j)` involves a nested loop, which takes `O(n^2)` time.
    - Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

- **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is `O(1)` if we disregard the input array space, as we are modifying the input array `A` in place and using a constant amount of extra space.
