## Algorithm Steps

1. **Update Node Values**:
   - Assign the value of the next node to the current node's value.
   - Point the current node's next pointer to the next node's next pointer, effectively skipping the next node.

## Time Complexity

- Updating node values and pointers: O(1)

## Space Complexity

- No additional space used: O(1)
