## Algorithm Explanation

The goal is to determine the maximum score we can achieve by forming words using the given letters, where each letter has a specific score associated with it.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize Count Arrays**:
    - Create two vectors, `count` and `lettersCount`, both of size 26 (for each letter in the English alphabet).
    - `count` will store the frequency of each letter available in the `letters` input.
    - `lettersCount` will temporarily store the frequency of letters used so far in forming words.

2. **Fill the Count Array**:
    - Iterate through the `letters` vector and populate the `count` vector with the frequency of each letter.

3. **Backtracking Function**:
    - This function will explore all possible combinations of words to maximize the score.
    - The function `backtracking` is called with initial parameters.
    - For each recursive call:
        - Check if the current combination of letters used exceeds the available count. If yes, return.
        - Update the maximum score (`ans`) if the current score (`temp`) is higher.
        - Iterate through the remaining words starting from the current position (`pos`).
        - Add the current word’s letters to `lettersCount` and update the score (`temp`).
        - Recursively call `backtracking` for the next word.
        - Backtrack by removing the current word’s letters from `lettersCount` and adjusting the score (`temp`).

4. **Return the Maximum Score**:
    - After exploring all possible combinations, return the maximum score found (`ans`).

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
    - The time complexity is O(2^N), where N is the number of words. This is because each word can either be included or excluded, leading to 2^N possible combinations.

- **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is O(N + M), where N is the number of words and M is the size of the `letters` vector. This includes:
        - The recursive call stack which can go up to O(N) in depth.
        - The `count` and `lettersCount` vectors, each of size 26 (constant space).
