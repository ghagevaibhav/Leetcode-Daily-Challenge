# Palindrome Partitioning Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

## Algorithm Explanation

The given solution uses a backtracking approach to generate all possible palindrome partitions of a string. Here's a detailed explanation of the algorithm:

### `partition` Function
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a list `ans` to store the result of all palindrome partitions.
   - Create a list `path` to store the current partition being explored.
   - Call the `solver` function starting from the 0th index of the string.

### `solver` Function
2. **Base Case**:
   - If the starting index `ind` reaches the length of the string `s`, it means a valid partition has been formed.
   - Add the current `path` to the `ans` list and return.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Iterate through possible ending indices from `ind` to the end of the string.
   - For each index `i`, check if the substring from `ind` to `i` is a palindrome using the `isPalindrome` function.
   - If the substring is a palindrome:
     - Add the substring to the `path`.
     - Recursively call the `solver` function for the next index `i + 1`.
     - Backtrack by removing the last added substring from the `path`.

### `isPalindrome` Function
4. **Palindrome Check**:
   - Check if the substring defined by the indices `start` and `end` is a palindrome.
   - Compare characters from both ends of the substring moving towards the center.
   - If any characters do not match, return `false`.
   - If all characters match, return `true`.

## Complexity Explanation

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(N * 2^N)**, where `N` is the length of the input string `s`. Here's the breakdown:
- **Partition Generation**: 
  - Each character in the string can either be included in the current partition or start a new partition.
  - This results in `2^N` possible ways to partition the string.
- **Palindrome Check**:
  - Checking if a substring is a palindrome takes **O(N)** time in the worst case.
- Combining these, the overall time complexity is **O(N * 2^N)**.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is **O(N)** for the recursion stack and the space used to store the partitions.
- **Recursion Stack**: The depth of the recursion tree can go up to `N`.
- **Path Storage**: The space required to store each partition path is **O(N)**.
- **Result Storage**: The space required to store all partitions is also **O(N * 2^N)** due to the exponential number of possible partitions.
- Combining these, the overall space complexity is **O(N * 2^N)**.

In summary, the algorithm uses backtracking to explore all possible partitions and ensure that only palindromic partitions are considered. The time and space complexity are both exponential in the worst case due to the nature of the problem.
