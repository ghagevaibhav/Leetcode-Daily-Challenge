## Algorithm Steps

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Ensure the input vector `happiness` is not empty.

2. **Sort the Happiness Array**:
   - Sort the `happiness` array in non-ascending order to maximize overall happiness.
   - This step ensures that we prioritize selecting the highest happiness values first.

3. **Iterate for k Rounds**:
   - Repeat the following steps for each round:
     1. **Adjust Happiness**:
        - Decrease the happiness of the `i`th element by `i`, capped at 0.
        - This adjustment ensures that the happiness of earlier selected elements decreases progressively.
     2. **Calculate Sum of Happiness**:
        - Add the adjusted happiness value of the current element to the sum of happiness.
     3. **Move to the Next Element**:
        - Increment the index `i` to move to the next element in the sorted array.

4. **Return Sum of Happiness**:
   - Return the total sum of happiness calculated after k rounds of adjustments.

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time.
- Iterating over the array for `k` rounds takes O(k) time.
- Overall time complexity is O(n log n + k).

## Space Complexity
- The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.
- Space complexity is O(1).
