# Algorithm Explanation

## Problem:
Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, the task is to:
1. Convert each character in the string to its corresponding numeric value (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).
2. Concatenate these numeric values to form a new string `number`.
3. Perform a transformation on this `number` string `k` times where each transformation involves:
   - Summing the digits of the string.
   - Converting the sum back into a string for the next transformation.
4. Return the final result as an integer after all `k` transformations.

## Algorithm:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an empty string `number` which will store the numeric representation of the input string `s`.
   
2. **Character Conversion:**
   - Loop through each character `x` in the string `s`.
   - Convert the character to its corresponding numeric value using the formula: `x - 'a' + 1`.
   - Append the numeric value as a string to the `number`.

3. **Transformation Loop:**
   - Initialize a loop that will run `k` times.
   - In each iteration:
     - Initialize a temporary variable `temp` to store the sum of digits.
     - Loop through each character `x` in the `number` string.
     - Convert the character to an integer and add it to `temp`.
     - After summing all digits, update `number` to be the string representation of `temp`.
   - Decrement `k` by 1 after each iteration.

4. **Return Result:**
   - Convert the final `number` string to an integer and return it.

## Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity:
- **Character Conversion:** 
  - This step involves a single loop through the string `s`, which has a length of `n`.
  - Each conversion operation (character to numeric string) is constant time `O(1)`.
  - Therefore, this step takes `O(n)` time.

- **Transformation Loop:**
  - Each transformation involves summing the digits of the string `number`.
  - The length of `number` after conversion depends on the size of `s` and can be up to `2n` digits.
  - Summing the digits takes `O(m)` time where `m` is the length of the current `number` string.
  - As the number of digits decreases significantly after each transformation, the overall time for `k` transformations is approximately `O(k * m)`. Since `m` is proportional to `n`, this is `O(k * n)`.

- **Total Time Complexity:**
  - The total time complexity is `O(n) + O(k * n) = O(k * n)`.

### Space Complexity:
- **Auxiliary Space:**
  - The primary space usage is for the `number` string, which can be up to `2n` in length.
  - Additional space is used for temporary variables, but this is minimal.
  - Therefore, the space complexity is `O(n)`.

**Overall:**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(k * n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
