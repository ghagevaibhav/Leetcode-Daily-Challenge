# Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

## Problem:
The task is to construct a 2D array of dimensions `m x n` from a given 1D array `original`. The 2D array should be filled row-wise from the 1D array. If the size of the 1D array does not match `m * n`, the function should return an empty 2D array.

## Algorithm:
1. **Initialization**:
    - Start by creating a 2D vector `result` with `m` rows. Initially, each row is an empty vector.

2. **Size Check**:
    - Check if the product `m * n` (which represents the total number of elements in the desired 2D array) equals the size of the `original` 1D array.
    - If they are not equal, return an empty 2D vector since it's impossible to construct the 2D array.

3. **Construct the 2D Array**:
    - If the size check passes, iterate over the rows of the 2D vector:
        - For each row `i`, slice the `original` vector from index `i * n` to `(i * n + n)` and assign it to the current row of `result`.
    - Continue this process until all rows are filled.

4. **Return Result**:
    - After constructing the 2D array, return the `result` vector.

## Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity:
- **Initialization**: Initializing the 2D vector `result` takes O(m).
- **Size Check**: The size check operation is O(1).
- **Array Construction**:
    - The slicing operation to fill each row involves iterating over `n` elements.
    - This operation is done for each of the `m` rows, so the time complexity for this part is O(m * n).
- **Overall Time Complexity**: O(m * n).

### Space Complexity:
- **Auxiliary Space**: The auxiliary space used by the algorithm is O(1) since no extra space is used other than the input and output structures.
- **Total Space Complexity**: The space used by the `result` vector is O(m * n) because it stores `m * n` elements.
- **Overall Space Complexity**: O(m * n).

In summary, the algorithm efficiently converts a 1D array into a 2D array with a time complexity of O(m * n) and a space complexity of O(m * n).
