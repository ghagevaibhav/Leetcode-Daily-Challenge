# Algorithm and Complexity Explanation

## Problem Summary

Given a list of integers representing the amount of chalk each student uses in a round and an initial number of chalk pieces, the goal is to determine which student will run out of chalk.

## Algorithm

1. **Calculate Total Chalk Needed:**
   - Traverse the `chalk` array to sum up the total chalk required for one complete round of all students. This is stored in `totalChalkNeeded`.
   
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of students.

2. **Calculate Remaining Chalk:**
   - Determine the remaining chalk after several full rounds by taking the modulo of `initialChalkPieces` with `totalChalkNeeded`. This is because chalk usage repeats cyclically every full round.

   - **Time Complexity:** O(1).

3. **Determine the Student Who Runs Out of Chalk:**
   - Traverse the `chalk` array again and decrement `remainingChalk` by each student's chalk usage.
   - The first student for whom `remainingChalk` is less than their chalk usage is the one who will run out of chalk. Return this student's index.

   - **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of students.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) 
  - The algorithm involves two passes over the `chalk` array. Each pass has a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the number of students.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
